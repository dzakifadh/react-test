# React Test

## Scope

Create a simple/small image search engine connected to the pixabay api in ReactJS with this Mockup ( itâ€™s a mockup, feel free to do your own UX/UI ):

Rules

- [x] Use at least once await and async functions (to get data from API)

## How to release

Please create a public github project with this small React JS Project and share the link with me !

## Please let me know if there any better approaches for this case, thanks
