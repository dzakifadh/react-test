# React Test

This repository is documenting about react test

## Project Description

Hello there, i will describe about this react test. First of all i need between 15-20 minutes to create this project, it look so long right? Because I didn't work on the React project for 1.5 months, that's why I needed a little warm-up to remember all react concepts. But if I hired, i will take a time to warming up for preparation, so when the project get started i ready to show my best performance.

If you look at my commit history, then you will see messages that are push gradually, because I remember the note "If you can deliver a good user experience" sentence "user experience" here I remember to make some improvements at some time, yeah so maybe that's a little explanation from me.

Thank you
